## Test Driven Development (TDD)
#### In layman’s terms, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach that combines programming, the creation of unit tests, and refactoring.

###### The TDD approach derives its roots from the Agile manifesto principles and Extreme programming. As the name suggests, the test process drives software development. Moreover, it’s a structuring practice that enables developers and testers to obtain optimized code that proves to be resilient in the long term. In TDD, developers start creating small test cases for every feature based on their initial understanding. The primary intention of this technique is to modify or write new code only if the tests fail. This prevents duplication of test scripts.

### Three phases of Test Driven Development
#### Create precise tests: Developers need to create precise unit tests to verify the functionality of specific features. They must ensure that the test compiles so that it can execute. In most cases, the test is bound to fail. This is a meaningful failure as developers are creating compact tests based on their assumptions of how the feature will behave.
#### Correcting the Code: Once a test fails, developers need to make the minimal changes required to correct the code so that it can run successfully when re-executed.
#### Refactor the Code: Once the test runs successfully, check for redundancy or any possible code optimizations to enhance overall performance. Ensure that refactoring does not affect the external behavior of the program.
